"""
Here's an example of using the Differential Evolution (DE) optimization method from the scipy.optimize module to minimize an objective function m that takes an input x, with the constraint that i < j => x[i] < x[j]:
"""


import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def m(x):
    # Objective function to be minimized
    return (x**2).sum()

def constraint(x):
    # Constraint: i < j => x[i] < x[j]
    for i in range(len(x) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(x)):
            if x[i] >= x[j]:
                return False
    return True

lenx = 10 # Length of x
x0 = np.random.rand(lenx) # Initial guess for x

# Call the minimize function with DE optimization method and constraints
res = minimize(m, x0, method='differential_evolution', constraints=[{'type': 'ineq', 'fun': constraint}])

print("Optimal x:", res.x)
print("Optimal value of objective function:", res.fun)

"""
In this example, the constraint function is defined to enforce the ordering constraint i < j => x[i] < x[j] by checking if any x[i] is greater than or equal to x[j] for i < j. The constraint function returns False if this condition is not met and True otherwise. The minimize function is then called with the differential_evolution optimization method and the constraints parameter set to a list containing a single constraint with type='ineq' to indicate an inequality constraint and fun=constraint to provide the constraint function.

The result of the optimization is stored in the res object, which contains the optimal value of x and the objective function m in res.x and res.fun respectively.
